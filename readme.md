TI has some new devices for BLDC control

- MCF8316A for sine odial motors
- MCT8316A for trapezoid types

Both have the same IC and PIN out.

With some nice TI utilities you can create con fig files like MCF8316A_example.json.

With this project I wanted to create C file to include in Microchip or other embedded tools.


Start the exe.... MCF/MCF in the RET directory open the save file.
Run it the it make a MCF8316A_example.c
You need to define what Type of CPU you want.
